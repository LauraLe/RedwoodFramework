					<p>Welcome to the experiment!</p>
					<p style="font-weight:bold;">Please read these instructions before you continue</p>
					<p>
					<ul>
						<li>You must have registered at ORSEE before you login and participate in this experiment. If you haven't done that, please
							contact the experimenter.</li>
						<li>Please do not use your browser's BACK, FORWARD or REFRESH/RELOAD buttons during the experiment. If you encounter a
							technical difficulty please contact the experimenter.</li>
						<li>If you have any questions, please raise your hand and one of the experimenters will approach you <strong>privately.</strong></li>
					</ul></p>
					<p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>
					<p>When you start the experiment (by clicking Ready below) you will first participate in a visual perception contest.
						The top half (approximately) of participants that perform better in the contest will be assigned to be Proposers and the
						remaining half (approximately) will be assigned to be Responders. If you have performed poorly in the contest, you
						might not continue to the second part of the experiment at all (depending on the number of participants in your session).</p>
					<p>If you become a Proposer you will receive a $<span>{{$P}}</span> base payment and earn the right to make offers of the sort:
						How much of an additional $<span>{{config.maxX}}</span> bonus, would you like to offer an anonymous Responder?
						You are free to decide on the offers: they could be identical or different - it is totally up to you.
						Each offer must be a value between $<span>{{config.minX}}</span> and $<span>{{config.maxX}}</span>.</p>
					<p>If you become a Responder you will receive a $<span>{{$R}}</span> base payment and will then receive several offers from different anonymous Proposers.
						For each offer you will have the choice to ACCEPT or REJECT.</p>
					<p>The offering process is divided into <span>{{config.k}}</span> rounds and several offers will be made to different anonymous Responders each round.
						After all rounds are complete, each Proposer will have interacted with each Responder exactly once. During each round the Proposer will receive feedback
						on whether each offer was accepted or rejected and can use this information to influence their offers in the next round.</p>
					<p><strong>Payment:</strong></p>
					<p>Each participant will receive their base payment plus a possible bonus of between <span>{{config.minX}}</span> and <span>{{config.maxX}}</span> dollars.
						In order to calculate the bonus, a single offer from a single round will be randomly selected.
						Let the value of this offer be $X. If the offer was accepted then the Proposer will receive a bonus of <span>{{config.maxX}}</span>-X dollars
						and the Responder will receive a bonus of X dollars. However, if the offer was rejected, then neither the Proposer nor the Responder will receive any bonus.
						In other words: each participant will receive a bonus (in addition to the base payment) according to only one of the offers (s)he made or received
						and only if that particular offer was accepted.</p>
					<p><strong>Anonymity:</strong></p>
					<p>Every effort is being made to guarantee that your identity and choice remain confidential: participants do not know the roles of
						other participants and have no way to identify an offer with Proposer or a acceptance/rejection with a Responder. Furthermore, the
						payment will be prepared in sealed envelopes by another experimenter who cannot identify the participants in the experiment.</p>
					<hr/>
					<p><strong>Estimation Game:</strong></p>
					<p>When you click the "Ready" button on this page, you will see a plot that looks like the one shown below. </p>
					<img ng-src="{{IMAGE_URL}}/plot.png">
					<p>As you can see, there are 10 circles scattered within the box. On the next picture there will be many more circles.
						Your job will be to guess how many there are in the picture that follows. The catch is you will only have 5 seconds to see the box.
						Those whose guesses are closest to the correct number of circles will earn the right to become Proposers.</p>
